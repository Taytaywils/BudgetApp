            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                Budgeting is daunting, I know. I was at the beginning of 
                it once, but as you heard in the video, it has literally 
                changed my life. I used to be so stressed about money and 
                finances. My wife and I would talk all the time about our 
                goals but we didn't know how we were going to accomplish them. 
                That is when we decided to take control of our finances.
            </p>
            <p>
                My parents raised us talking about finances and how to make
                 smart financial decisions, how to save, the importance and 
                power of investing, and more. It was obvious from a young age
                that this was important to them and that they wanted it to be
                important for their kids as well.
